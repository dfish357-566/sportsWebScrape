            "3D Archery                a form of archery in which  the goal is to strike  targets in the shape of animals at unknown distances.                                                                                                3D Archery is a form of archery in which  the goal is to strike at targets without  knowing exactly how far away the targets  are. Besides shooting skills, the archers should also be highly skilled in  estimating the distance to the targets. 3D archery is currently practiced both  recreationally and competitively.      The targets used for 3D archery are shaped  in the form of various animals and their size closely matches that of the life-size animal. The kind of animals used varies with different clubs.Regardless of the animal type, each target will be  marked with a set of scoring rings. Each ring corresponds to a certain number of  points, and the smaller the ring the higher the points it carries. The exact  points fixed for each ring varies with different clubs, but most clubs award 11  or 12 points for the smallest ring, the ring at the heart carries five points, the lung  scores eight, and five for the body.      A match is played for a certain fixed  number of targets where each target is placed at a different distance. The  player with the most number of points for all targets combined is the winner.3D archery, though played competitively, is  prevalent only in local clubs and most competitions are only at a club level.

The format involves no stoppages for goals, and a simultaneous clock for both matches.Most regular ice hockey rules apply, though body-checking is not allowed. There is also  no icing or offside. If the game is tied after  regular time, there is a penalty-shot shootout to decide the winner.Â The sport made its international debut at the Lausanne 2020 Youth Olympic Games, and there are hopes  for its inclusion  at future events.

            "Abseiling                an adventure sport where the participants  descend  a steep formation using a rope. (not really a sport).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Abseiling  is a popular adventure sport technique used by climbers when they are on a  steep cliff or slope and it is dangerous to descend from it without protection. Abseiling does not fit in the definition of a real sport as there is no competitive element, though it is listed here due to similarities to other sports such as rock climbing.The origin of this climbing technique is attributed to Jean Charlet-Straton who  was a Chamonix guide. He was the founder of this abseiling method of roping  down from a cliff.The equipment which is required for this technique are ropes, anchors,  helmets, gloves, knee pads, boots and an auto block knot. This adventure  climbing sport  is popular with climbers in Australia, Ireland and many  other countries. Aside from the sport of abseiling, there are many rope technicians who are using this technique  to access the difficult to reach areas from above for a variety of industrial  applications, for instance, construction, inspection and maintenance and  welding.

Artistic  component looks for choreography and moves in sync to music. Execution looks  for technical aspects of the routine, and the Difficulty component looks for  the degree of difficulty of the moves performed. Points are awarded for each routine on a 10  point scale. The team with the most points for all three routines combined is  declared as the winner.Acrobatic Gymnastics/Sport Acrobatics is part of the World Games  event, and is exclusively contested in theÂ   Acrobatic Gymnastics World Championships.  [Balance : These routines  involves holding static in certain formations, typically towers or pyramids,  for specific time durations. It tests athletes for strength and flexibility. , Dynamic : These routines  involves throws, catches, twists and somersaults, that test athletes for power  and strength., Combined : This routine has to  included elements from both balance and dynamic routines., Sport Aerobics — the objective is to perform  high-intensity  gymnastic moves  in sync with  background music., Calisthenics — a competitive team sport in which athletes perform elements of  rhythmic gymnastics and ballet, Cheerleading — a dubious sport in which groups of cheerleaders do routines that are subjectively assessed., Pole Dancing — participants perform  various type of acrobatic moves like spins, climbs, twists and body inversions around a pole., Aesthetic Group Gymnastics — a team sport where a  large group of gymnasts perform coordinated continuous movements., Rhythmic Gymnastics — uses the elements of ballet, gymnastics, dance, and apparatus manipulation., Complete list of sports, The Encyclopedia of Sports, Complete List, What is a sport?, Categories, Timeline]\n"
